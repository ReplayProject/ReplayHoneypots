<p>Hello, and welcome to Scanme.Nmap.Org, a service provided by the <a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap Security Scanner Project</a> and <a href="http://insecure.org">Insecure.Org</a>.

<p>We set up this machine to help folks learn about Nmap and also to test and make sure that their Nmap installation (or Internet connection) is working properly.  You are authorized to scan this machine with Nmap or other port scanners.  Try not to hammer on the server too hard.  A few scans in a day is fine, but dont scan 100 times a day or use this site to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool.

<p>Thanks<br>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Scanme.Nmap.Org, a service provided by the <a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap Security Scanner Project</a> and <a href="http://insecure.org">Insecure.Org</a>.

<p>We set up this machine to help folks learn about Nmap and also to test and make sure that their Nmap installation (or Internet connection) is working properly.  You are authorized to scan this machine with Nmap or other port scanners.  Try not to hammer on the server too hard.  A few scans in a day is fine, but dont scan 100 times a day or use this site to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool.

<p>Thanks<br>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Scanme.Nmap.Org, a service provided by the <a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap Security Scanner Project</a> and <a href="http://insecure.org">Insecure.Org</a>.

<p>We set up this machine to help folks learn about Nmap and also to test and make sure that their Nmap installation (or Internet connection) is working properly.  You are authorized to scan this machine with Nmap or other port scanners.  Try not to hammer on the server too hard.  A few scans in a day is fine, but dont scan 100 times a day or use this site to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool.

<p>Thanks<br>
-<a href="http://insecure.org/fyodor">Fyodor</a>

<p>Hello, and welcome to Scanme.Nmap.Org, a service provided by the <a href="http://nmap.org">Nmap Security Scanner Project</a> and <a href="http://insecure.org">Insecure.Org</a>.

<p>We set up this machine to help folks learn about Nmap and also to test and make sure that their Nmap installation (or Internet connection) is working properly.  You are authorized to scan this machine with Nmap or other port scanners.  Try not to hammer on the server too hard.  A few scans in a day is fine, but dont scan 100 times a day or use this site to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool.

<p>Thanks<br>
-<a href="http://insecure.org/fyodor">Fyodor</a>
