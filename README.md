<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This project strives to provide a highly configurable, low interaction honeypot and a
system to handle multi-node deployments.

The Replay honeypots are a security tool designed to monitor and collect information
about the networks they are deployed on. This project began in 2019, and has been
growing in multiple ways. In July 2020 it was made open source! The most notable
components of the system are the:

-   Honeypots
-   Management System
    -   Data Collection / Export Solution
    -   Frontend Analysis
    -   ReplayCLI
-   Deployment Strategy

Currently, the project supports **Docker** and **Baremetal** deployment options,
although Docker is simpler for managing multiple devices simutaneously.

To expedite the analysis of honeypotsâ€™ logs, a web-based management frontend was created
with local authentication using Node.js, Passport.js, and Vue.js. The frontend provides
a way for users to query the log database as well as be alerted of potential attacks,
problems, and/or configuration changes of deployed honeypots. The user may also export
data to an external SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) by utilizing
the database's API.

Additionally, we have created an automated deployment and configuration tool called the
HoneyCLI. This is a command line tool that assists in the administration of honeypots.
This tool assumes that the user has set up SSH keys to connect to the system which they
intend to deploy a honeypot on. Although it uses Docker for its deployment, this tool
can also be configured to deploy honeypots on bare-metal machines.
